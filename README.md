# Supply-Chain-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using PowerBI)
## Project Objective
The objective of this Supply Chain Analysis project is to monitor and optimize key performance metrics such as revenue, product sales, defect rates, supplier lead times, and transportation efficiency. It aims to support data-driven decisions for improving supply chain performance and operational efficiency.

## Database Used
- <a href="https://github.com/pranjalzaware/Supply-Chain-Analysis/blob/main/database_supply%20chain%20analysis.csv">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total revenue generated?
- How many products have been sold?
- What is the average defect rate across products?
- Which supplier has the fastest lead time?
- How does revenue correlate with the number of products sold?
- What are the inspection results indicating product quality?
- What is the distribution of product types (skincare, haircare, cosmetics)?
- Which transportation modes are most frequently used?

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/pranjalzaware/Supply-Chain-Analysis/blob/main/Supply%20Chain%20Analysis%20Dashboard.pbix">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
- Data Collection
  Gather data from multiple sources such as sales, suppliers, inspections, and logistics systems.
- Data Cleaning & Integration
  Clean the raw data (remove duplicates, fix errors) and integrate it into a unified dataset.
- KPI Identification
  Define key performance indicators like revenue, product sold, defect rate, lead time, etc.
- Dashboard Design
  Build a visual dashboard to represent metrics using charts, graphs, filters, and gauges.
- Analysis & Insights
  Analyze trends, identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and monitor supplier and product performance.
- Decision Support
  Use insights from the dashboard to make informed supply chain decisions and improvements.
